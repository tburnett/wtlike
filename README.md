## Introductinon

This package has code that was adapted to the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) code/tests/documentation environment from the [github package lat-timing](https://github.com/tburnett/lat-timing) to manage light curves of Fermi-LAT sources.  
It is based on a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00140.pdf) by Matthew Kerr, which derives the [weighted likelihood formalism](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/loglike#The-Kerr-likelihood-formula) used here, specifically with
the [Bayesian Block](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5578.pdf) to detect and characterize variability of a gamma-ray source.

Also, I've ported some code from  my [jupydoc](https://github.com/tburnett/jupydoc) documentation package supporting enhanced documentation combining Markdown and code, such that the 
Markdown reflects execution of the code.

## Installation

Note that this is still in alpha mode. 

To install from pip:

```
pip install wtlike
```
Data requirements: There are three sets of files:

- **photon data**<br> 
These are a set of weekly pickled python `dict` objects with compressed condensed photon and spacecraft data extracted from the GSFC FTP site. They contain every photon above 100 MeV, and less than $100^\circ$ 
from the zenith.

- **weight tables**<br>
Each source to be analyzed needs a table defining the photon weight as a function of position, energy, and event type. These are currently generated by pointlike. (A `fermipy`-generated version would be preferable.)

- **effective area**<br>
A standard fermi instrument response file (IRF) defining the effective area as a function of detector angle and energy. 

A set of these is available as a 1.6 GB zip file.

## Quick Demo

The following code cell loads the data for the BL Lac blazar, and plots by default, a weekly light curve for the full *fermi* mission.

```python
from wtlike import *
if Config().valid:
    weekly = WtLike('BL Lac') # how to define 7-day bins for the full dataset.
    weekly.plot(ylim=(-0.8,15)); #plot takes plt.plot args.
```

    SourceData: photons and exposure for BL Lac: Restoring from cache with key "BL Lac_data"
    WtLike: Source BL Lac with:
    	 data:       310,969 photons from 2008-08-04 to 2021-05-06
    	 exposure: 3,177,752 intervals,  average rate 3548 cm^2 for 95.0 Ms
    	 rates:  source 2.30e-07/s, background 6.92e-07/s, S/N ratio 0.33
    CellData: Bin photon data into 665 1-week bins from 54683.0 to 59338.0
    LightCurve: select 656 cells for fitting with e>10 & n>2

The variable `weekly` has lots of capabilities.
To examine a subset of the data at the end of the current data, we use `view` to create a new `WtLike` object and plot it.

```python
# hourly_at_end = weekly.view((-5,0, 1/24)) # for the last 5 days, 1-hour bins
# hourly_at_end.plot(); # Accepts plt.plot args, e.g. xlim, ylim, etc.
```

Or, to do a Bayesian Block partition with these 1-hour bins, perform fits, and overplot the result, just run the following.

```python
# bb_hourly = hourly_at_end.bb_view()
# bb_hourly.plot();
```

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-4-fb6fa2dba4e3> in <module>
    ----> 1 bb_hourly = hourly_at_end.bb_view()
          2 bb_hourly.plot();


    NameError: name 'hourly_at_end' is not defined


Finally, let's look at the values plotted above:

```python
#bb_hourly.fluxes
```

## Input data

There are three data sources which `wtlike` needs to function:


-	The photon/spacecraft data
-	A table of weights for each source
-	An effective area IRF table 

These must be found under a folder, which by default is `~/wtlike_data`. In that folder there must be (perhaps links to) three folders named `data_files`, `weight_files`, `aeff_files`.  A copy of what I'm using is at `/afs/slac/g/glast/users/burnett/wtlike_data`

## Module summary

### Configuration [config](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config)
Implements basic configuration information, [Config](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Config), a cache system [Cache](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Cache), point source info [PointSource](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#PointSource), and [time conversion](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Time-conversion)

### Photon and Spacecraft Data  [data_man](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/data_man)
This module manages conversion of the weekly FT1 (photons) and FT2 (spacecraft) files, downloaded from  [GSFC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/lat/weekly), to a folder containing  pickled files, each with tables of photons, space craft data, and a list of GTI times derived from the FT1 file. A class [WeeklyData](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/data_man#WeeklyData) exports the results.

### Source data  [source_data](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/source_data)
The module depends on a specific source. It extracts the photons within a disk, and calculates the exposure for this direction. It assumes that a weigtht analysis has been done for this source, which it uses to apply a weight to each photon. This is handled by the class [SourceData](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/source_data#SourceData). It depends on [weights](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/weights) and [effective_ares](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/effective_area) to evaluate exposure.

### Cell data [cell_data](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/cell_data)
The next step is to define a set of time bins, or "cells". This module, implementing the class [CellData(SourceData)](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/cell_data#CellData), creates a set of cells.

### The light-curve  [lightcurve](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/lightcurve)
The the class [LightCurve(CellData)](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/lightcurve#LightCurve) uses the set of cells created by its superclass, and generates a likelihood function for each according to Kerr Eqn 2. These functions are represented by 3-parameter Poisson-like (see [poisson](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/poisson)) functions for further analysis. It creates a table with this information for plotting a light curve.

### Bayesian Blocks [bayesian](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/bayesian) 
This module contains the code implementing the  Bayesian block capability. 

### Simulation [simulation](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/simulation)
A light curve can be also generated with a simulation.

### Main [main](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/main)
Implements [WtLike(LightCurve)](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/main#WtLike/), a subclass of `LightCurve`, to which it adds the function `bb_view`, returning a new object with BB cells. Its `plot` funtion generates a light-curve plot showing the cells of its parent, overplotted tiwh the BB points.
