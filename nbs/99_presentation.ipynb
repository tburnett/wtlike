    "Kent finds, using autocorrelation, a significant precession period (~52 day) signal in some parts of the sky, especially the GC. This needs to be understood and corrected immediately. It does not seem to affect Geminga, with only a 4% systematic resolution degradation, or any of the pulsars that I have studied, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pointlike rather than gtlike\n",
    "The weights tables should be similar, but gtlike is the collaboration standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute fluxes\n",
    "The weighted likelihood provides *relative* count flux values vs. time, relative to the average flux for the full time interval. However, the weights were determined by the 12-year DR3 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nearby variable sources\n",
    "\n",
    "As pointed out in the  [LCR \"about\" page](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/LightCurveRepository/about.html),\n",
    "there are \"15 other variable sources within a 12 deg radius\". But in the case shown, the nearest variable source is $4.8^\\circ $ away. A weak pulsar $4^\\circ$ distant shows no effect.\n",
    "Actually, another source has to be within a few degrees to have an impact. The Kerr scheme assumes that the background is constant, at most allowing for an overall rescaling which would not describe the effect of a nearby source. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, given the position-dependent weight tables for both sources, each initally determined assuming the other is constant, allows a straight-forward modification for overlapping pixels. The dominant case, that\n",
    "only one is varying at a time is easy. This a future project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GRBs and solar flares\n",
    "Could be locally masked out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data file availability\n",
    "The 3 GB that are needed (which compress to a 2 GB zip file) need to have a publicly available place for distribution. Fermi collaboarators who have a SLAC account could access them via scp (they are at /afs/slac/g/glast/users/burnett/wtlike_data), but I want a public repository, ideally with a cron job to perform daily updates of the photon data.\n",
