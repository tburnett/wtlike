    "  * **wtlike**: Perform the above using only the binned data, then save the weights in a table allowing lookup for individual photons at a later time, perhaps on data collected after the table creation. That is, the data can be,\n",
    "within a few minutes. brought up to the most recent GSFC release.\n",
    "* Photons and livetime info for any direction are taken from a compact version of the full FT1/FT2 set of files.<br>\n",
    "This makes the system very portable, with <3GB needed, with no need for the full `fermipy` package, and much faster to start a source, and especially to generate a new binning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a Poisson-like representation of the likelihood.<br>\n",
    "It turns out that any likelihood evaluated with the Kerr formula, involving a lot of computation, can be safely approximated with a 3-parameter scaled Poisson function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exposure is calculated based on the energy and event type, rather than assuming a power-law.<br>\n",
