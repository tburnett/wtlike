    "This package has code that was adapted to the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) code/tests/documentation environment from the [github package lat-timing](https://github.com/tburnett/lat-timing) to manage light curves of Fermi-LAT sources.  \n",

    "- **Photon data**: time, energy, and position. This is managed as a [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) database, derived from the public _Fermi_-LAT data. Modules are [`photon_data`](/wtlike/photon_data) and `data_man`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposure**: Need to normalize expected rates as a function of time, position, and energy. Modules: [`exposure`](/wtlike/exposure.html), [`effective_area`](/wtlike/effective_area.html), and [`gti`](/wtlike/gti.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weights**: for each photon, this is the probability that it was from a specific source. This requires an analysis of all the souces in the region about the source, involving `gtlike` or `pointlike`. Module `weights` finds the data for a the source, and adds it to the photon list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The light-curve \n",
    "The module `cells` creates a list of \"cells\", time intervals with a list of the photon weights, and an estimation from the exposure about the expected distribution. \n",
    "Each cell is fit using the modules `loglike` and `poisson`.\n",
    "Finally, `lightcurve` makes a list of the fits.\n",

    "### Simulation\n",
    "A light curve can be also generated with a simulation, see `simulation`.\n",

    "### Bayesian Blocks\n",
    "The `bayesian` module creates a partition, and refits the blocks.\n",
