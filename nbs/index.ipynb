    "This package has code that was adapted to the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) code/tests/documentation environment from the [github package lat-timing](https://github.com/tburnett/lat-timing) to manage light curves of Fermi-LAT sources.  \n",

    "Implements basic configuration information, [Config](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Config), a cache system [Cache](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Cache), point source info [PointSource](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#PointSource), and [time conversion](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/config#Time-conversion)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photon and Spacecraft Data  [data_man](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/data_man)\n",
    "This module manages conversion of the weekly FT1 (photons) and FT2 (spacecraft) files, downloaded from  [GSFC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/fermi/data/lat/weekly), to a folder containing  pickled files, each with tables of photons, space craft data, and a list of GTI times derived from the FT1 file. The total size of this is 2.8 GB. A class [WeeklyData](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/data_man#WeeklyData) exports the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source data  [source_data](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/source_data)\n",
    "The module depends on a specific source. It extracts the photons within a disk, and calculates the exposure for this direction. It assumes that a weigtht analysis has been done for this source, which it uses to apply a weight to each photon. This is handled by the class [SourceData](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/source_data#SourceData). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell data [cell_data](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/cell_data)\n",
    "The next step is to define a set of time bins. This module, implementing the class [CellData(SourceData)](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/cell_data#CellData), creates a set of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The light-curve  [light_curve](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/lightcurve)\n",
    "The the class [LightCurve(CellData)](https://tburnett.github.io/wtlike/lightcurve#LightCurve) uses the set of cell defined by its super class, and evaluates the likelihood for each. This function is represented by a Poisson-like function for further analysis. It creates a table with this information for plotting a light curve.\n",
